How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable by trying to utilize the most direct and shortest lines possible. I ensure that achieve all the functionality in the goal and make sure that I hit all targets.
In reference to building a CRUD python module I found that it was incredibly customizable to tailor the operations to what I need, but unfortunately I feel that this could have all been completed through the modern Dash application we were working with. Another way to use a CRUD module like this is to make the code as intricate as I want without having to pull it into the dashboard. I feel this will help my programs remain modular.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I approach problems as a computer scientists one at a time, I also ensure that what I'm doing takes the priority for the day/week and I remain focused until I hit my milestones. I feel that cookie cutter projects like this limit you in your learning. You are already going at a breakneck speed and dealing with outdated technology. The templates should be vague but milestones should be given so we can explore the tech as it will help us in our learning.
Some strategies I used were to completely revamp and load the program on my own device and use modern web applications to make the site. 


What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer scientists do a lot of things. They figure out problems, they work in academia, they work at a help desk. Computer science is a foundation. My work on a project like this will help an organization make better buisiness decision and help visualize the things they need to work on to ensure the company has the best glidepath towards success.
